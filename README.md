# Vision Images and Examples

## Sample Images

- [2016 Full Field](2016_RealFullField)

## Notebooks

These are [Jupyter] notebooks containing Python and OpenCV examples. The Jupyter Notebook is a web application that allows us to create and share documents that contain live Python code, visualizations and explanatory text.

The links below will display a read-only copy of the notebook. Clone the repository and run Jupyter locally in this directory to experiment with them.

- [Random Image](notebooks/Random%20Image.ipynb): displays a random image from the [sample directory](RealFullField/).
- [Basic Image Arithmetic](notebooks/Basic%20Image%20Arithmetic.ipynb): demonstrates addition and subtraction from image pixel values.
- [Masking the Target](notebooks/Masking%20the%20Target.ipynb): several methods for creating a mask from a target image.
